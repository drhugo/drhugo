- Hi, I’m Hugo Ayala (@drhugo).
- I’m interested in computer graphics, video (mxf, HDR)
- I'm also interested in Machine Learning, in particular with regards to images
- I'm also interested in ETL for Geographic data
- I'm afan of [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) and of writing tests.  Look at some of my public repositories for examples.
- I'm also a fan of Qt as a application development framework
- Most of my experience has been in writing C++ code.  I practice [structured programming](https://youtu.be/SFv8Wm2HdNM?si=_OO7xiVI3fI1I8q1) and of the GNU style of writing code -- but I also think other styles are fine.
- I have some public repositories, including
  + [ovalToRaster](https://github.com/drhugo/ovalToRaster) which can be used to raterize a list of ovals into a rasters
  + [parse_options](https://github.com/drhugo/parse_options) which is a header-only implementation for a library to parse options from the command line
